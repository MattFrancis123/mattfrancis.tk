    <td>Starting point:</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have a easy to navigate, user friendly and good looking site</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I have reached my target today as I have (as you can see) made massive improvements to my site and thus making it much better</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I worked today through the means of trial and error and finding ways of getting around things. This proved very useful when working with him to get my site up and running on his server. Whenever I was stuck instead of immediately asking him, which would eventually annoy him, I tried to work it out for myself and find an appropriate solution for the problem. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main factor that limited my learning today was the fact that I was on my own for the majority of the time that I was working on the site. This proved an issue as when I was truly stuck and the internet couldn't help I would have to wait for the next day to ask someone for help. I need to work on my collaboration, which will in turn solve this problem.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will aim to work more collaboratively and get more of the harder work down when I am around people who will be able to help me when I am stuck, and leave some of the easier work for when I get home. This will allow me to do more challenging work, whilst still achieving enough.</td>

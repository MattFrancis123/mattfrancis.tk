# Colouring

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Starting point:</th>
    <td>I have already got a website with multiple posts and it is easy to read, however the colour scheme isn't the best</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Target for this lesson?</th>
    <td>To have my site looking good whilst being able to read</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>
    <td>Yes, my site is very easy to read and I have created the table to house all of this information in an organised way</td>
  </tr>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Lesson Review</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson I learnt by independence and trial and error. When ever I got stuck I wouldn't immediately ask for help, rather try things, and more importantly look things up on the internet when I was really stuck. This helped me to work more independently and ultimately get better at coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, I was limited by the fact that I talked too much to the people sitting near me when I could have been getting on with other thng. This relates to the habits of independence and self determination.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I need to not talk to the people around me too much and get on with my work more. I could do this by telling them at the beginning of the lesson that we should get more work done in the hope that they will think the same, thus making us all more productive.</td>

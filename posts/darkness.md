# A Really Long Story
## How the universe _wasn't_ created

Verily, for I have had revealed unto me the Truthful Doctrine of the Great Invisible Darkness, I walk upon the cliff-face. A deep sensation forms over me, for I see before me an Invisible Darkness: and logically I know It is there from the simple Presence. I was approached by It from behind, which did attempt to eat the iPad I am writing on right now. "Away," I cried. And this was the manner of it. "Foul beast, would thou take away the light?"  
Then did the Invisible Darkness look down upon me, and spake: _"Child, you do not know me?"_  
And I said, _"Verily, it is not my habit to communicate with invisible beings such as yourself,"_ for I had felt Its Great presence speaking with me.
And the Invisible Darkness spoke thus: _"Quit it with the 'verily' bit, okay? Know, then, you ignorant being, that you are in the presence of the One You Have Sought, but never found."_

And lo! The Invisible Darkness' Greatness disappeared, and with it the silence of It. I found myself to be in the Presence, and indeed was the Presence Dark, and, yet such with the overwhelming nature of the Presence that I could not, in truth, look upon It.
For indeed, my friends, it is for this reason that the Great Invisible Darkness is called Invisible, that is, the Presence is much too great for our small eyes to truly see, and too awesome for our minds to comprehend. It is by our faith alone that we know that It is both Dark, and Great. Verily, we understand that this is Truth, for our faith tells us so.

And thus spoke unto me It who is Dark, and said, _"Write this stuff down."_ Therefore I did search my pockets, whereby I found three blackjacks, and also a ballpoint pen. Then did Its Equine Self come down to me and touch said pen. Indeed, It had turned my ballpoint pen into [an expensive Apple device](http://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini-2), and for this, I was Grateful.

And thus, I wrote the following down.

---

In the beginning, there was only the Darkness. A Great, Invisible Darkness, whereby all of thought and creation is passed through. There was only the Darkness, and nothing but the Darkness. Sometime, Its Equine Self concluded that it was lonely in the Presence of only oneself. Verily, It settled to create Light, and with a single thought, "Let there be a Light for me to talk to," the enemy of the Darkness was born. Light, as small as it is, did not have the power or the Presence to attack upon the Darkness, however we may only see the Light, as it is much less Great than the Great Invisible Darkness, and verily, we are able to fathom the size of it. Light began as a tiny speck, but soon Its Equine Self pressed on, creating another child, Life.

For, my friends, Life began as a child of the Great Invisible Darkness. And that Life saw that it was, in Itself, good. Not Great, as Its Dark Father, but rather, only good. Life began to create young children: Cow, Fish, and Bird. Cow walked, Fish swam, and Bird flew. Life's children, however, had nowhere to walk, swim, or fly. Thus, they created a Universe, encompassed within the Great Invisible Darkness, where they could freely roam.

Cow and Fish also needed somewhere to walk and swim, and thus, designed World. So, the World was born. World began to take shape, form, and being. Cow created the land, a beautiful place with high peaks to allow Bird to settle, separated by Fish' oceans and sea. The Great Invisible Darkness and Light fought over World; but eventually, they came to an agreement. At morning, Light awakens, and at dusk, the Presence overwhelms it. Verily, this is why the World swaps between Light and Dark each day. World needed friends, so they came to be. World had many friends, each of whom he called his "planets." The Great and Invisible Darkness saw that his creations were Good, and that It was Great.

And, for now, It saw that they were Good: Cow walked. Fish swam. Bird flew. Cow created more of herself, and thus Fish and Bird did the same. Now, many cows, fish, and birds went into the World of the Darkness. Some birds found it Good to sleep during Light, and wake during Dark in order to be in the Presence. Some cows morphed into unique beings, some standing on four legs, and others eight. Some fish wanted to become more like the cows they saw on the land, and thus learned to live, like Life, in many places. Darkness gave each creature a unique name to distinguish them from others.

The Great Invisible Darkness found, soon after, that things may never always be Good. It saw that everything Good comes to an end, a Bad end. And then, may become Good once again. He saw this in the most unique cows, those that had chosen to have only two legs: the Men, and the Women. The Men loved the Women, and the Women loved the Men. At times, they would argue. This reminded the Darkness of It and Light's argument over World in centuries past. He separated some, and gave Men ability to love other Men, and Women to love other Women. They were all given this choice, as anything and everything is in the Darkness' power. For It is Great, and Life is Good. The Great and Invisible Darkness forgave those who argued and fought, as anyone can become Bad, but they always have the power to become Good once again. It would not give Men more Greatness over the Women, as this would create more arguments. And, as It had seen, arguments were Bad. And forgiveness was Good.

The Great and Invisible Darkness looked down at all that was Good: Light, Universe, Life. World, Cow, Bird, Fish, Men, and Women. **They were fighting again.**

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson I learnt by trial and error. When I was stuck on something, instead of immediately asking someone, I would try as many possibilities myself before asking someone. This proved very using in a multitude of occasions throughout the lesson as it would be more time efficient than having to wait for someone to help.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was held back from my full potential when because wherever I was stuck, I almost immediately asked someone. However, towards the end of the lesson I was doing this less. Furthermore, I prevented my learning by talking to people too much about other IT subjects that were not relevant.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will try to help myself from the very beginning of the lesson, and be more efficient thus getting more done. To add to this I will try to talk much less to Fitz about the work and thus get more done quicker.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>I want to distinguish between different types of the tables, like the table titles, and normal table text.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I have creates af distinguished the different types of text in the table and you can now easily see what's what with the help of bigger sized text.</td>

    <td>This lesson I learnt by doing, instead of googling it, I would simply try it and only if it didn't work I would the google it. This made me very effective this and I could get a lot of work done in a relatively short amount of time. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>One major aspect that limited my learning (and I donâ€™t want to sound obnoxious here) is that I had to listen to Mr Keen as he taught the class how to create gradients on the background, something I had already figured out, tried it but then defended to not keep it due to having a better background.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will ask Mr Keen of I can continue working on my website whilst he is talking about things that I already know, and only fully listen to him when he is telling me new information. This will enable me to do much more with my site in smaller amounts of time, again making me more efficient.</td>

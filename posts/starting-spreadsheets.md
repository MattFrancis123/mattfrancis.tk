(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>
    <td> Yes, I think that I did, I created a spreadsheet that will take a list of stock and a order form and calculate the grand total of it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This lesson I learnt by both doing and listening. I had to listen to Mr Keen very intently at the beginning of the lesson, as I really had no clue on what to do. But, once he had given me some basic information, I was able to use this to expand my knowledge of spreadsheets.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main factor that limited me learning was that I really had zero clue on what to do in spreadsheets. Although this was out of my control, I could have used my initiative and simply searched these things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will have known much more about spreadsheets and I will be able to easily and efficiently work on more harder work. This will allow me to learn much more harder work, in a smaller amount of time.</td>
